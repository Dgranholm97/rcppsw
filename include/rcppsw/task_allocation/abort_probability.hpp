/**
 * @brief Calculates the probability that a robot will abort the task it is
 * currently working on using the negative exponential distribution.
 *
 * Reactivity and offset are assumed to both be < 0.
 *
 * Depends on:
 *
 * - The reactivity parameter: How sensitive should robots be to abrupt changes
 *   in task estimates/execution times.
 * - The proportionality parameter: What should the current_exec/prev_estimate
 *   ratio be assumed to be when the robot does not any estimates of the task's
 *   execution time (i.e. it is executing the task for the first time).
 * - The offset parameter: How much the current_exec/prev_estimate ratio will be
 *   allowed to grow before causing the probability to grow exponentially.
 *
 * - Time estimates for the task.
 * - How long the robot has spent executing the current task.
